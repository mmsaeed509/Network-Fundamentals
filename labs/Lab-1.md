- Routers
  - ![Routers](./imgs/network-devices/Routers.png)
  - Network routers are devices that forward data packets between computer networks. They operate at the network layer of the OSI model and are crucial for directing traffic on the internet.

- Switches
  - ![Switches](./imgs/network-devices/Switches.png)
  - Network switches connect devices within a local area network (LAN). They operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and efficiently manage data traffic between devices.

- Hubs
  - ![Hubs](./imgs/network-devices/Hubs.png)
  - Hubs are basic networking devices that connect multiple devices in a LAN. Unlike switches, hubs do not intelligently manage traffic and simply broadcast data to all connected devices.

- Wireless Devices
  - ![WirelessDevices](./imgs/network-devices/WirelessDevices.png)
  - Wireless devices include access points and other components that enable wireless communication. They are essential for setting up Wi-Fi networks, allowing devices to connect without physical cables.

- Security
  - ![Security](./imgs/network-devices/Security.png)
  - Security devices, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, play a vital role in safeguarding networks from unauthorized access, attacks, and other security threats.

- WAN Emulation
  - ![WAN-Emulation](./imgs/network-devices/WAN.png)
  - WAN emulation devices simulate wide area network (WAN) conditions in a controlled environment. This helps in testing and optimizing applications for performance over real-world network conditions.

- Console
  - ![Console](./imgs/connections/Console.png)
  - Console connections are used for direct, out-of-band access to networking devices. They are often employed for device configuration and troubleshooting.

- Copper
  - ![Copper](./imgs/connections/Copper.png)
  - Copper connections refer to traditional wired connections using copper cables, such as Ethernet cables. They are commonly used for reliable and high-speed data transfer within a network.

- Fiber
  - ![Fiber](./imgs/connections/Fiber.png)
  - Fiber connections use optical fibers to transmit data using light signals. Fiber-optic cables offer high bandwidth, faster data transfer rates, and are resistant to electromagnetic interference.
